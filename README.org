2017 (c) Joseph Wright <joe@joegle.com>

* About
  + Purpose of fluency to build fluency with common scripting language expressions and library calls
  + I am often searching for the same group of 
  + and I think I should just memorise these commonly used patterns
    + with spaced repetition

** High level user story
   1. User adds material to learn
      - Use git submodules
      - system parses content and initializes scores
   2. System selects idiom to challenge user (sorts the corpus; filters with UI)
      - an idiom-challenge consists of:
	- prompt
	- grading function
	  - solution
	  - solution form
   3. User responds to challenge
      - Produces score
	- correctness
	- time taken to answer
	- previous responses
   4. System updates score of idiom
   5. Repeat 

** Considering
   + Question types
     + select true statements from list
     + fill in the blank of censored code / free text
     + multiple choice
     + honor code self-grade
     + analogy
     + Running code
     + Label/annotate this highlight
   + Group consensus
   + prolog database
   + Long term response
     + are responses archived?
